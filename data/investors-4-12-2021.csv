SOSV,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sosv,https://sosv.com/,"East Coast, Northeastern US","SOSV is a global venture capital firm that operates startup accelerator investment programs. SOSV’s programs are focused on two broad areas. The first is a revolutionary technology that promises the betterment of humanity and the planet. The second is cross-border markets, notably in Asia, that are ripe for explosive growth.  The firm’s strategy is to invest in a small number of highly promising startups and use its deeply resourced programs to accelerate product development, acquire customers, and scale. SOSV companies consistently achieve funding led by top-tier investors. SOSV joins seed, series A, and later rounds while providing founders with ongoing support and community.  The five programs work with 135 new companies each year. At the close of 2020, SOSV had more than 1,000 portfolio companies and $855 million in assets under management. SOSV’s accelerator programs include hardware-oriented HAX and life-science-driven IndieBio. Both offer deep technical expertise on-site as well as well-equipped lab and fabrication facilities. At Chinaccelerator and MOX, market-entry and product development experts help entrepreneurs win cross-border market opportunities across Asia. SOSV’s latest program, dlab, fosters new players in the blockchain ecosystem. Among the top companies in SOSV’s portfolio are NotCo, Perfect Day, Memphis Meats, Yeelight, Opentrons, BitMEX, and API3. Founder Experience  SOSV programs review applications from all over the world, and any pre-seed or seed-stage company is welcome to apply. For most programs, SOSV provides $150,000 - $250,000 in exchange for a small amount of equity. Certain biotech startups may receive as much as $500,000 or more from the Genesis Consortium, a partnership between IndieBio and the Mayfield Fund.  Founders usually spend 4 to 6 months in a uniquely formative cohort experience marked by intensive coaching from on-staff experts (including successful founders), regular workshops led by mentors and guests, and access to technical resources, including labs and other facilities needed for research and product development. No less remarkable than the rapid advances founders make in the programs are the deep and lasting friendships they form with fellow founders and staff. After a program’s completion, the SOSV partners continue working closely with founders to bring on lead investors for follow-on investment. Unlike most accelerator programs, SOSV continues to invest as a major syndicate participant - up to 20% of new rounds - in subsequent seed, series A, and later investments. In a typical year, SOSV aims to invest at least twice as much in follow-on rounds as in the accelerator programs for that year. In 2020, SOSV invested $46 million in post-accelerator rounds; in total, SOSV portfolio companies 2020 raised $1 billion.  In addition to funding, SOSV continues to support the development of founders and their startups long after their programs are complete.  SOSV provides expert legal resources, sales and customer development, and mentorship resources across many disciplines. Founders are also encouraged to tap the 2,000+ SOSV founder network. Background  Managing Partner Sean O’Sullivan founded SOSV in 1995, following the IPO of MapInfo, a startup he co-founded that pioneered computer-based street mapping. O’Sullivan is deeply committed to social betterment through entrepreneurship and technology, a theme that runs deeply through the SOSV portfolio. He has donated millions in SOSV profits to charitable causes, including the Khan Academy and CoderDojo, as well as many other educational and humanitarian efforts. SOSV commits 10% of its carry (SOSV profits from venture investing) to philanthropy.  SOSV is also deeply committed to creating a portfolio rich in founder diversity. In a 2017 TechCrunch / Crunchbase analysis, SOSV was one of only four seed funds with a female founder in 30% or more of portfolio companies. At the end of 2020, 34% of SOSV’s portfolio companies had at least one female founder. Performance and Limited Partners SOSV’s fund performance is consistently in the top quartile of venture funds around the world, according to Cambridge Associates. Among SOSV’s limited partners are corporates, financial institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals from around the world, including Credit Suisse, Tiedemann Advisors, Davy Group, Nan Fung Group, ZX Ventures (the strategic arm of Anheuser-Busch InBev), HP Ventures, and Sumitomo Corp. In SOSV’s Fund IV ($277 million), 50% of the limited partners are located in North America, 25% in Europe, and 20% in Japan and Southeast Asia. SOSV Programs SOSV has seven general partners and 132 staff across nine locations around the world.  SOSV General partners Cyril Ebersweiler and Duncan Turner operate HAX, which Ebersweiler launched in 2012 and has offices in Shenzhen, San Francisco, and Tokyo.

The San Francisco and New York programs run two, 15-company classes each per year.  General partner William Bao Bean and partner Oscar Ramos lead Cross Border Internet and Software at SOSV including Chinaccelerator, founded in 2010 by General partner Cyril Ebersweiler, and MOX, founded in 2015, with teams in Shanghai, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur, and New Delhi.

Founded in 2008, betaworks is a company of builders.  A tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, products and data brought together in imaginative ways to build out a more connected world. At first glance we seem to do many things. But first and foremost, we're builders, seeking to create a more sustainable innovation model. The more we build, the more we learn, the more we get ideas for peripheral things, all related, connected -- in a loosely coupled network of products and companies.    betaworks is structured as a company-- a single company that owns larger pieces of the things it has built and smaller pieces of the things it has invested in. It operates as a network: a tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, and data united to build out a more inspired and useful connected world.  betaworks makes seed-stage investments in this ecosystem. To us, seed investing means ""first money in."" Our typical investment size is $150,000-200,000. We always invest as part of a syndicate of angels and early stage VCs.   Our requirements from an investment perspective are simple, though narrow. Investments must be early stage, heavily tech focused, and have a working (public or private) prototype. We are a powerpoint-free zone. We build and work closely with companies that we view as core to our vision, examples include: [Summize/Twitter Search](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/summize/),  [bitly](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitly-2),  [TweetDeck](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tweetdeck), [Chartbeat](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chartbeat).

We attract the kind of people who could start their own company, but they don't necessarily want to run a company.

The group was formed in February 2004 and since then has made a number of investments in companies in medical devices, IT, consumer products, business products, specialty materials, Internet, aviation, etc. They believe they contribute more than money to the companies they fund and welcome the opportunity to work with entrepreneurs open to take advice, yet having the smarts and determination to make the company successful. Their focus is on early stage companies usually looking to raise $250K to $1.5M, where they can fund a portion of the round and syndicate the deal with other angel groups or early stage venture funds. The stage of the company should be close to commercialization, while the company should have a clear and defensible competitive advantage. They are looking for capital efficient businesses, which can reach profitability with less than $5M of equity investment and provide at least 10X return on the investment within 5 years. They do not invest as a fund - each of their members makes his or her individual investment decision but they collaborate in Due Diligence. They have a deep expertise in the life sciences field where they usually take the position of a lead investor, but are open to any opportunities that can make a strong business case. In some cases they prefer to be the follow on investor if they cannot identify a person with strong expertise within their group. The groupâ€™s strategy is directed by an executive committee which consists of 8 people elected by the group: Wayne Griffith (chairman), Bill McPhee, Henry Kay, Jay Schwartz (membership director), Steve Andress, Peter Miller, Don Freeman and Mic Williams (president and founder). The groupâ€™s day-to-day operations are managed by Boris Batchvarov (managing director). They receive 20-30 business summaries each month, out of which they select 8 companies to make a personal presentation to their screening committee. The screening committee consists of volunteers from the group. The presentations are 10 min long followed by 10 min Q&A. 4 of the companies are invited to present to the whole group, with the idea to get the people interested and decide to perform a Due Diligence with the companies before making an investment.","Finance, Financial Services, Venture Capital","Financial Services, Lending and Investments","Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Seed",Angel Group,121,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",info@bostonharborangels.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/boston-harbor-angels-inc./,,,,,,

Since 1981, Rho Ventures has been investing in innovators that redefine the status quo. Rho’s investment philosophy does not fit a conventional model, much like the visionary innovators we back. We believe that formulaic approaches to investing lead to risk averse strategies that stifle innovation and differentiation. We actively avoid restrictive boundaries around ideas, growth opportunities and entrepreneur profiles. To find extraordinary opportunities, we are not bound by a particular stage of investment and do not shy away from contrarian ideas. We believe that great companies take root in unconventional places and that successful entrepreneurs frequently break the mold. The ideas we back come from a variety of sources: an MBA student who is trying to change new media advertising practices; an experienced entrepreneur seeking to commercialize a disruptive biofuels technology; or an executive looking to spin out and develop an abandoned asset developed by a pharmaceutical company.  We are seasoned investors who have backed more than 200 companies through multiple cycles. Identifying interesting opportunities and providing capital is just the beginning. We offer deep-sector expertise in today’s high-growth markets, but we do not let any one area of knowledge guide our overall investment strategy. Ultimately, we look for entrepreneurs who we can help make very big waves, not just stir the waters and move on to the next venture.","CleanTech, Financial Services, Venture Capital","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Sustainability","Debt, Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture, Private Equity, Seed","Private Equity Firm, Venture Capital",107,"New York, New York, United States",businessplans@rho.com,514.844.5605,http://www.linkedin.com/company/85331,,,,,,

Skyline Ventures,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/skyline-ventures,http://www.skylineventures.com,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast","Skyline Ventures, formed in 1997, is a nationally-known venture capital firm that specializes in investing in outstanding product-focused healthcare companies. Their areas of expertise include small molecule and protein therapeutics; medical devices; diagnostics; and technologies that facilitate drug discovery and life science research. They all have MD or PhD degrees, and hands-on operating experience in various start-up healthcare companies that later went public. As a result, they are known for the value they offer their companies, as board members and shareholders. They are also known for being fundamental, extremely patient investors. The days when momentum investing drove the public biotechnology markets are long gone, and they are glad that they are. The public markets demand data, not dreams. As a result, it is data that drives their decision process. In considering a new investment, they focus on whether there is adequate proof of principle to believe that the company's products will work. In therapeutics, for example, they look closely at whether the biochemistry, animal models and any human data make it more probable than average that the product will eventually prove to have an important therapeutic benefit. The size of the potential market and the quality of the management or founding team are critical in their evaluation as well. Skyline Ventures are value and return driven, more than driven by the stage of the investment. Most often they lead or co-lead a company's first or second institutional venture round, but have previously helped found companies and invested in PIPEs and leveraged buyouts. In October 2007, they completed raising Skyline V, which has $350 million in committed capital. They have approximately $800 million under management. They target investments of $15-35 million per portfolio company over the life of the company.","Finance, Financial Services, Venture Capital","Financial Services, Lending and Investments","Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture",Venture Capital,70,"Palo Alto, California, United States",,650-462-5800,https://www.linkedin.com/company/skyline-ventures,,,,,,

Allos Ventures,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/allos-ventures,http://allosventures.com,"Great Lakes, Midwestern US","In Indiana, Ohio, and the surrounding region, there is a significant gap between the number of early-stage companies seeking venture capital and the amount of venture capital targeting such investments. Angel investor (high net worth individuals) activity and state-based support for start-up companies have been accelerating — driving the creation of more businesses seeking venture capital. At the same time, several of the early-stage venture firms that historically served this region, particularly those investing outside of the life sciences, are no longer making new investments. Others have shifted to later-stage (i.e. already profitable) companies. And, firms based on the coasts are hesitant to invest in ""flyover"" land, or at the very least like to have a local lead. All of these trends have made it hard for entrepreneurs to continue the momentum started with the help of their friends, family members, and angel investors. We formed Allos in early 2010 to help fill this gap. We only invest in early-stage companies, augmenting the capital provided by angel investors who have helped the companies reach a stage at which they are ready for their first institutional financing round.","Enterprise Software, Software",Software,"Early Stage Venture, Late Stage Venture",Venture Capital,67,"Carmel, Indiana, United States",,317.275.6800,https://www.linkedin.com/company/allos-ventures,,,,,,

Advances in cloud and other computing technologies radically reduce the costs of starting and running new businesses, creating opportunities for outsized returns. We invest in teams we believe in and our experience suggests that finding good founding teams and leaving them in place tends to produce higher returns overall.  As a corollary, we resist shackling a company to its original business model. Businesses really do evolve over time and changing models in the early years is anything but a sign of weakness. We do not expect that the first business model for a company will be the final or best business model and do not see evolution as a negative. The most powerful minds are the ones that can be changed.  We believe that substantially all of our investments should be directed to companies with an audacious vision seeking enormous markets. So, we will continue to invest in very talented entrepreneurs who are pursuing ambitious, challenging tasks.

Illuminate is typically a startup’s first institutional investor, but can also be a fit for an established company seeking its first equity financing. Their sweet spot is Series Seed rounds – filling the gap between angel capital and larger funding rounds of traditional VCs. When the timing is right, they collaborate with the best large-scale firms for the next round of financing, but they love lean start-ups that preserve flexibility in their early years. With three funds under management, Illuminate has been an early investor and board member in deep technology platforms like BrightEdge Technologies (SEO market leader), SaaS applications like Xactly Corporation (NYSE: XTLY) and early market innovators like Influitive (customer advocacy).","Analytics, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Mobile, SaaS","Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Mobile, Software","Early Stage Venture, Seed","Micro VC, Venture Capital",49,"Oakland, California, United States",contact@illuminate.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/illuminate-ventures/,,,,,,
