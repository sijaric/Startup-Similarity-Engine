# Startup-Similarity-Engine
Similarity metrics and surveys done on financial and technology documents between parent and child companies with Python.

See "NLP_Final_Project" for an elaboration on the results produced during our survey of (1) the Jaccard Similarity (Base- line), (2) Cosine Similarity, (3) Traditional TF-IDF, (4) Word-Mover’s Distance (ML-based), and (5) Sent2Vec (ML-based) algorithms. 

On the basis of Crunchbase- derived sets of textual descriptions of funded startups from VC portfolios, we found that the high degree of similarity within our data, and unquantifiable events that make up real-life investment decisions, complicates efforts to build a trained model capable of matching portfolio companies to their respective VC partners. Nevertheless, by tightening our threshold value and by pursuing less ML-driven methods for establishing similarity, we observed an increase in the prediction accuracies, making this methodology suitable for attempts to meaningfully match startups to appropriate VC portfolios. The deeper question of what makes a good “match”, however, must be further researched, if a more complete answer to our research question is to be reached.
